            </p>
            <p>
              CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
              services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to
              require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
              operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
              consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
              information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being
              shared. - See more at:
              http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
            </p>

            <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
            <p>

              <b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of
              13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in
              control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency,
              enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
              services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
            </p>

              <b>Fair Information Practices</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
              United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
              development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
              Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
              comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
              responsive action, should a data breach occur:
            </p>
            <p>We will notify you via email</p>
            <p>• Within 1 business day</p>
            <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>

            <p>• Within 1 business day</p>
            <p>
              We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
              the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors
              who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
              enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
              courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
              processors.

              The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
              requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
              stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
